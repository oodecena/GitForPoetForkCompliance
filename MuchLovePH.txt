For someone to whom i truly care

Time has flown since the day we said goodbye
We fought our silent wars, not a tear nor a cry
Though the path was rough we stayed side by side
As friends we vowed in this rollercoaster ride

One rowdy night, our feelings glowed
Revealing our thoughts that we dared to unload
Though its heavy burdens I did bear
I listened close our hearts laid bare

In the end i learned the truth
Alas my heart is sailing smooth
Though things didn’t work out as i hoped for
I want you to know, I’ll still be here for sure

I just hoped that if by the time you’re ready
Please assure me that you’re significant one would be worthy
If I somehow found out that you’re not being treated fair
I would gladly drop everything just to show how you should be looked after with care
